Concepts I learned:

( Already learned but solidifying my understanding on these )
http request - requesting to the server
http response - reply from the server

environment - stuff happening and stuff existing in the background while main code executes
environment variables - are for sensitive information / API keys
middleware - has access on: client side and server side / request and response

5 layers - Presentation, Application, Business logic, Data Access, Infrastructure 

Environments: Test, Dev, Production 

Webpages and view are not the same

Middleware functions gets executed first, after pass() is called within it, Route Handler function gets executed next
Middleware functions are usually for validating input, storing input, authenticating input
Route Handler functions are usually for rendering, sending files to user, sending data to user

Express.js code contains prepared algorithm for the given URL and what kind of http request it is





























node.js 

open source
cross platform
runtime environment
api
thread
query

developer is the car designer/engineer
user is the driver
browser is the windshield
node.js is an engine -- node.js is environment

node.js gets you to your destination
node.js gets sends you off to where you want

node.js is like security guard in a security room, only acts when robbers are spotted

async vs sync
with async, two textboxes are being typed in by computer
with sync, one textbox is only being typed and it has to finish for the other textbox to start getting typed on too

node is a c++ program that takes js file and gives it to v8 engine

node.js has module wrapper function, the javascript code is actually wrapped in an 'invisible' function already

global object (node.js) vs window object (normal js)

single thread = waiter -- takes order and delivers dishes, switches tasks and keeps itself busy
